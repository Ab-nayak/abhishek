Floods occur when water overflows onto normally dry land, usually due to heavy rainfall, river overflow, dam failure, or rapid snowmelt. They can cause severe damage to homes, crops, roads, and infrastructure, and can lead to loss of life and displacement of people. Floods also disrupt ecosystems and spread waterborne diseases. Proper drainage systems, flood forecasting, and early warning systems help reduce their impact.

The Northern Hemisphere is the half of Earth that lies north of the equator. It includes most of the world’s landmass, continents like North America, Europe, most of Asia, and parts of Africa and South America. About 90% of the global population lives here. The seasons are opposite to those in the Southern Hemisphere—summer runs from June to September, and winter from December to March. The North Pole, Arctic Ocean, and famous landmarks like the Himalayas and Sahara Desert are also in this hemisphere.

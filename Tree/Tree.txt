**Essay on Trees (150 words)**

Trees are one of the most important gifts of nature. They provide us with oxygen, which is essential for life. Trees also absorb carbon dioxide, helping to reduce air pollution and combat climate change. They offer shade, cool the environment, and prevent soil erosion with their roots.

In addition to their environmental benefits, trees are home to many birds, animals, and insects. They give us fruits, wood, medicine, and paper. Trees play a vital role in the water cycle by attracting rain and maintaining groundwater levels.

Trees also make our surroundings beautiful and peaceful. Parks, forests, and gardens filled with trees offer places for people to relax and enjoy nature. Sadly, many trees are being cut down for development and industries.

It is our responsibility to protect and plant more trees. By doing so, we can ensure a healthy planet for future generations. Trees truly are life-givers.

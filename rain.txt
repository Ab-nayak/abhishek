Rainfall is the amount of water, in the form of liquid precipitation, that falls to the Earthâ€™s surface from clouds. It occurs when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses into droplets, which combine until they are heavy enough to fall due to gravity. Rainfall is measured in millimeters (mm) or inches over a given time period, using instruments like a rain gauge. It plays a crucial role in replenishing water sources, supporting agriculture, and maintaining ecosystems. The amount and distribution of rainfall vary by season, location, and climate, and it can be influenced by factors like monsoons, cyclones, and topography.

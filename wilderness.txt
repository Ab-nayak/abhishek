Wilderness refers to natural areas that remain largely untouched by human development, where ecosystems exist in their original state. These regions are often remote, vast, and rich in biodiversity. Wilderness areas provide habitats for wildlife, preserve genetic resources, and help maintain ecological balance. They also play a vital role in regulating climate, water, and air quality. For humans, wilderness offers opportunities for recreation, adventure, and spiritual renewal, while also serving as a reminder of the importance of conserving nature.
